# a3-d.signer
assignment for the course "Graphical User Interfaces" 

the assignment was to create a portfolio for a fictional disigner (called d.signer).
based on the given AI generated introduction, I created a persona and designed a
"speculative art/brutalist retro" themed portfolio that is purposefully far from my
personal aesthethic preferences.

> D. Signer is an interaction designer with a specialty in absurd, speculative 
design and non-conventional graphical user interfaces. They has worked on a variety
of projects, ranging from developing new interface concepts for addressing the climate
crisis to designing innovative ways to control physical devices. In their work, they
strives to create unique and unexpected experiences that challenge the status quo and
provoke thought. 

 when I read this paragraph, the line *challenge the status quo and
provoke thought * stood out and radiated pure main charachters vibes so I decided to 
to it into d.singer's slogen and a defining element of the design.
