When faced with the daunting task of climate change, it can be difficult to know where to start. "Future Deconstructed" is a project that deconstructs our current way of life in order to make us aware of the impact our everyday actions have on the planet. It is a powerful wake-up call that urges us to reconfigure the core of society and our institutions if we want any chance of averting disaster. 

Through reenactment, props and participatory design, "Future Deconstructed" drives home the message that we all need to take responsibility for our actions if we want to create a sustainable future. The project makes use of design fiction to provide concrete examples of how things could be different if we made some simple changes in our everyday lives. For example, one scenario imagines a future in which we no longer use disposable coffee cups, instead opting for reusable ones that can be composted when we're finished with them. This small change would have a major impact on reducing waste and saving resources. 

"Future Deconstructed" is an important project that should be experienced by everyone. It is a timely reminder of the choices we make and the impact they have on our planet. It is a call to action that urges us to rethink the way we live in order to create a sustainable future for all.
