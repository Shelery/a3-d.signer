Ungraphical user extrafaces is an absurdist design project that completely reverses the visual aspects of graphical user interfaces. The project was created in response to the increasing prevalence of graphical user interfaces, which the we felt were becoming too ubiquitous and simplistic.

The project sought to create a more complex and confusing interface by removing all visual cues and reversing the basic principles of design. For example, instead of buttons being labelled with words or icons, they were instead labelled with random numbers or symbols.

The overall effect was an interface that was almost impossible to use without prior knowledge or training. Despite its inherent flaws, the project gained a cult following amongst those who appreciated its challenge and unique approach. It also gained notoriety for being one of the most frustrating and unusable interfaces ever created.
